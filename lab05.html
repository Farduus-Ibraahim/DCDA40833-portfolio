        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>For this lab, I used AI as a collaborator in two different ways: redesigning and enhancing my portfolio (Experiment A) and generating a Python visualization in Google Colab using my gym attendance dataset (Experiment B). In both cases, the goal was not just to produce working code, but to actively understand, modify, and evaluate what the AI generated.</p>
            
    
        <h2>Experiment A: AI-Enhanced Portfolio</h2>
        <p> For Experiment A, AI helped me change my portfolio from a basic layout into something more polished. It generated a full-screen hero section, a sticky navigation bar with a frosted scroll effect, fade-in animations using the IntersectionObserver API, and a consistent design system using CSS variables. There are parts, we I was having a little hard time understanding the code but I understood the overall logic behind these features, especially how CSS variables create consistency and how scroll events trigger class changes. However, the IntersectionObserver syntax itself was new to me. I understand what it does and why it works, but I would still need to reference documentation to write it independently. I modified the color to better reflect my aesthetic, and adjusted responsive font sizing.</p>

            
        <h2>Experiment B: AI-Generated Python Colab</h2>
        <P> For Experiment B, I used AI to generate Python code to load my daily gym attendance dataset from Google Drive, check for missing values, convert the visit_date column into datetime format, and calculate the average workout duration by day of the week. At first, the AI assumed my dataset had a column named “Date,” which caused a KeyError. I had to inspect df.columns and correct it to visit_date. That debugging process showed how strict pandas is with column names and capitalization so I had to go back and fix. I understand how groupby() calculates averages across categories and why converting dates allows access to .dt.day_name(). I know what reindexing the days does, organizing them in calendar order, but I likely would not have thought to do that without AI prompting it.</P>

                <img src="images/Average_workout_duration.png" alt=" The average workout duration for each day" width="600">
                <figcaption>Average workout duration by day of the week</figcaption>
            </figure>

        <h2>Process Evaluation</h2>
        <p> AI was most helpful when I had a clear vision but lacked syntax knowledge. It accelerated structure, generated functional starting points, and introduced tools I had not used before. It was problematic when it made assumptions about my file structure or dataset, and when it produced overly complex solutions that needed simplification. One of the key things I noticed is that AI speeds up execution but does not replace verification. I still had to test, resize screens, read errors, and make judgment calls about what actually worked. I believe vibe coding helps learning when it is used intentionally especially when I slow down, ask follow-up questions, and read code line by line. Going forward, I plan to use AI as a structured starting point or debugging assistant, but not as a substitute for understanding.</p>
