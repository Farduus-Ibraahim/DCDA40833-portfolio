    <!-- CHANGE 1: Added two Google Fonts via <link> tags in the <head>.
         "Cormorant Garamond" is an elegant serif used for headings and display text.
         "DM Sans" is a clean, modern sans-serif used for body/paragraph text.
         Previously the site used the browser's default system fonts (Arial, Helvetica, etc.).
         Loading fonts here keeps everything in one stylesheet request and avoids flash of unstyled text. -->

    <!-- CHANGE 2: Rebuilt the <nav> element structure.
         Previously the nav had a flat <ul> with duplicate/broken <a> tags outside of <li> elements,
         which is invalid HTML. Now it is wrapped in a "nav-inner" div for layout control,
         includes a "nav-logo" span showing my initials "FI" as a personal brand mark,
         and has a single clean <ul> with one <li> per link — all valid, semantic HTML.
         The nav also now has id="navbar" so the scroll JavaScript can target it. -->
    <nav id="navbar">
        <div class="nav-inner">
            <span class="nav-logo">FI</span>

    <!-- CHANGE 3: Replaced the plain <header> with a full-screen "hero" section.
         The original header was a simple colored bar with centered text.
         The new hero uses class="hero" to apply a full-viewport-height dark background
         with decorative layered gradients and a subtle grid pattern (all done in CSS).
         
         Inside the hero:
         - "hero-bg" div: the decorative dark background layer (styled entirely in CSS)
         - "hero-eyebrow": small uppercase course/semester label above the name
         - "hero-name" h1: large display heading using Cormorant Garamond, with the last
           name wrapped in <em> so it renders in italic gold
         - "hero-sub": subtitle line in light uppercase letters
         - "hero-line": a short decorative gold horizontal rule that animates in
         - "hero-scroll": a small animated "scroll" indicator at the bottom of the screen -->
    <header class="hero">
        <div class="hero-bg"></div>

    <main>

        <!-- CHANGE 4: Added a numbered section label to each section ("01 — Welcome", etc.).
             This is a new <div class="section-label"> element at the top of every section.
             It uses a small gold uppercase label with a short decorative line after it (via CSS ::after).
             This creates a consistent visual hierarchy across all sections and makes the page
             feel more like a designed editorial layout rather than a plain document. -->

        <!-- CHANGE 5: Redesigned the Welcome section layout.
             Originally it was just a heading and a paragraph of text.
             Now it uses a two-column CSS Grid ("welcome-grid"):
             - Left column: a large italic blockquote pulled from my intro text, styled as a
               design element with a gold left border, to immediately catch the reader's eye.
             - Right column: the original welcome paragraph text.
             This makes the section visually interesting instead of a wall of text. -->

        <!-- CHANGE 6: Completely restructured the About Me section layout.
             Originally the photo was below all the text paragraphs in a centered figure.
             Now the section uses a two-column CSS Grid ("about-grid"):
             - Left column: the profile photo in a styled frame ("about-photo-frame") with a
               decorative gold border box ("about-photo-accent") offset behind it for depth.
             - Right column: three info cards ("about-card"), one for each of the three
               original paragraphs (Who I Am / My Interests / What I Hope to Learn).
             
             Each about-card has:
             - A decorative Unicode icon ("about-card-icon") on the left
             - An h3 heading
             - The original paragraph text
             - A hover effect that slides the card slightly to the right (done in CSS)
             
             This layout is far more scannable and visually engaging than a wall of paragraphs. -->

        <!-- CHANGE 7: Redesigned all portfolio cards.
             The original cards were simple anchor tags with a heading, a lab-tag badge, and a paragraph.
             The new cards ("portfolio-card") have a more structured three-part layout:
             - "card-number": a large faded number (02, 03, etc.) in the background-left area
             - "card-content": a category tag ("card-tag"), h3 title, and description paragraph
             - "card-arrow": an arrow "→" that is hidden by default and slides in on hover
             
             Added "portfolio-card--wide" modifier class on the last card (Hometown Map)
             so it spans the full two-column grid width, breaking the uniform grid pattern
             and drawing extra attention to that project.
             
             Also added a gold vertical line ("::before" pseudo-element in CSS) that
             animates from 0 height to full height when the card is hovered. -->

    <!-- CHANGE 10: Added a <script> block at the bottom of <body> with two JavaScript features.
         
         Feature 1 — Sticky navbar scroll effect:
         Listens for the window "scroll" event. When the user scrolls more than 60px down
         from the top, it adds the class "scrolled" to the navbar element.
         In CSS, the "scrolled" class applies a dark semi-transparent background and blur
         effect so the nav is always readable as you move through the page.
         When back at the top, the "scrolled" class is removed.
         
         Feature 2 — Fade-in on scroll (IntersectionObserver):
         Uses the browser's IntersectionObserver API to watch all sections, portfolio cards,
         reflection items, and about cards. When any of those elements enters the viewport
         (becomes 10% visible), the "visible" class is added to it.
         In CSS, elements start with opacity:0 and translateY(28px), and transition to
         opacity:1 and translateY(0) when "visible" is added — creating a smooth fade-up
         entrance animation as the user scrolls down the page. -->

            } else {
                navbar.classList.remove('scrolled');
            }
        });
